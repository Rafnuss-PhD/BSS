# Bayasian Sequential Simulator (BSS) #
BSS simulates a primary variable based on a collocated secondary variable.

## History and Developpement ##
The method was initially applied to the simulation of lithoclasses based on seismic impedance measurements (Doyen and Boer 1996). Later, Ruggeri et al. (2013, 2014) adapted the method to the regional-scale simulation of hydraulic conductivity guided by information provided electrical conductivity.
